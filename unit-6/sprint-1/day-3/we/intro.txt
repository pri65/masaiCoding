express => makes things easier for us
it is built on the top of http module of node 


## npm init -y
## npm i express
## npm i nodemon
## lastly when you want to execute your code
nodemon filename.js

* in express we need to remember two things method+route


## if nodemon is not working then run this command
npm install -g nodemon
