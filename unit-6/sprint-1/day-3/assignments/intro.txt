response.send -> adds the content to the response body. The content can be a Buffed object, a string or an Array.
response.status -> sets the HTTP status
response.json -> sends a JSON response (with the correct content-type) that is the parameter converted to a JSON string using JSON.stringify().



//building REST application
Express can help us to write a RESTfull API for our todoList app.
 -> GET / retrieve the list of tasks
 -> POST / create a new task
 -> PUT /:id update the task of id id
 -> DELETE /:id


 //we will use the parser-body module
 body parser is a middleware
 Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:
 -> Execute any code.
 -> Make changes to the request and the response objects.
 -> End the request-response cycle.
 -> Call the next middleware function in the stack.


 //Express allows to extract parameters from the url. A parameter is defined in an URL with the ":" prefix. It is available as a member of request.params.
